# Useful learning resources for cognitive neuroscientists

Simultaneously taking inspiration from others' lists and wanting to have a decidicated space for my own without having to save dozens of tabs, I have decided to create my own (non-exhaustive) list of links and pages for neuroscientists covering conceptual subject knowledge, statistics, software, programming, good research practices and online repositories. The list is geared more towards <b>cognitive neuroscience and experimental psychology</b>, and in particular those using <b>fMRI</b> (as this is my own subject area), but regardless of your field within neuroscience/psychology and beyond there should be some useful resources üòä 

I aim to update it frequently, and will purposely leave out some resources covered by others which I have not used personally. I also will focus more on resources that are <b>'online-oriented'</b> i.e., not articles or textbooks, although I will include guides written in the style of an 'online book' as they are interactive and often are the best method of learning. <b>Feel free to star/fork this repo or to suggest your own resources for me to add!</b>

## Existing lists of resources
Here are some current 'meta-lists' which already cover a lot of resources, if you don't see a particularly obvious resource in my list, odds are that it is in one of these:

### Practical application
Time to put that knowledge into action. These guides exclusively cover MRI/fMRI analysis as I don't use other imaging modalities such as EEG/MEG, fNIRS or TMS. I highly recommend reading through the official documentation released for the software (e.g., FSL, SPM) as well, which I have left out purposely. [This paper](https://applications.emro.who.int/imemrf/Basic_Clin_Neurosci/Basic_Clin_Neurosci_2012_3_5_71_83.pdf) provides a good overview of neuroimaging tools commonly used.

## Philosophy of neuroscience
What are the limitations of fMRI? What can/can't we infer about the brain using neuroimaging? What does it mean to observe statistically significant activity of the prefrontal cortex in response to a specific stimulus? Asking fundamental questions such as these are pivotal as neuroscientists to understand what our tools can and cannot be used for in our research.

## AI Tools
Artificial intelligence is now a pivotal component of academic work, whether we like for it to be or not. Whilst AI tools such as GPT were initially not recommended to be used for literature searches and summaries, recent models trained on domain-specific data (i.e., research papers) are significantly more effective, and are not plagued by the previous limitations such as generating fake references. Whether or not you decide to implement them in your own work is a personal decision, but here are some useful resources if you decide to.
