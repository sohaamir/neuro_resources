# Useful opportunity resources for neuroscientists ðŸ§  ðŸ“š

Similar to my neuroscience resources list, I found myself consistently saving loads of tabs associated with the various opportunities I came across. This primarily included summer schools, conferences, outreach programs, public events; essentially anything a cognitive neuroscientist PhD student in Birmingham could get involved with.

So, I felt the need to collate together another list, one with opportunities for neuroscientists (mainly within the UK). ðŸ˜Š 

I aim to update it frequently, but as with my other list (and lists in general) it is not intended to be comprehensive. Feel free to suggest your own resources for me to add!

## Existing lists of resources

Here are some useful current 'meta-lists' which already cover resources in the various sub-domains.

### General Opportunities

- [Scholarships Corner](https://scholarshipscorner.website/) A website covering scholarships, bursaries, competitions, exchange programs, and a lot more. It covers a varied selection of topics, including Psychology/Cognitive Neuroscience.
-[Psych Research List](https://www.psychresearchlist.com/) A website with various lists for Psychology students including: grad school resources, conferences jobs/internships and guest lecturers.
- [Simply Neuroscience](https://www.simplyneuroscience.org/) 'an international, student-led nonprofit organization dedicated to fostering students' interdisciplinary interests in the brain, specifically through neuroscience and psychology education, outreach, and awareness.'

### Conferences 

- [Nature Reviews Neuroscience - Conferences](https://www.nature.com/nrn/conferences)

### Summer schools

- [various computational neuroscience / MEEG / LFP short courses and summer schools](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nezjxkU8kGsA9MUI3Eph60s303VwfQLqMSNrSnnRSzk/edit#gid=1015366364) A Google Sheet with a fairly comprehensive list of summer schools in the field of computational neuroscience. Maintained by Natalie Schaworonkow, Ernst StrÃ¼ngmann Institute for Neuroscience.

### Outreach and Science Communication

- [JISCMail](https://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa-jisc.exe?A0=PSCI-COM) 'A list to provide a forum for discussion of any matter relating to public communication of science and public engagement with science. In addition, details of relevant events, meetings, jobs, conferences and workshops.'

## Conferences

I am deciding to focus specifically on those with a major focus on cognitive and computational neuroscience.
