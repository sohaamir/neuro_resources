# Useful resources for neuroscientists
This is a non-exhaustive list of links and pages for neuroscientists covering neuroimaging, programming and research skills. I aim to update it frequently, and will purposely leave out resources covered by others which I have not used. I also will focus more on resources that are 'online-based' i.e., not textbooks, although I will include guides in the style of an 'online book'.

## Existing lists of resources
Here are some current 'meta-lists' which already cover a lot of resources: 
- [Methods in Neuro](https://github.com/smweis/methods_in_neuro) Steven Weisberg's GitHub list of resources covering the physics of MRI/fMRI, computational/programming, tools for the analysis of MRI/fMRI data, and online datasets, as part of his 'Methods in Neuroimaging' course

## Research guidance, planning and open research practice
Getting into a field as complicated and challenging as cognitive neuroscience can be overwhelming. These resources are a great guide to organising one's research, 
- [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/index.html) - Must-read detailed guide on how to conduct research!
- [The Princeton Handbook for Reproducible Neuroimaging](https://brainhack-princeton.github.io/handbook/index.html) - A great guide for how to conduct reproducible neuroimaging research from the Princeton Neuroscience Institute
- [ARIADNE](https://igor-biodgps.github.io/ARIADNE/intro.html) A guidebook aimed primarily for early career researchers in the field of life sciences, detailing the process of conducting a transparent and reproducible research project from start to finish
- [Open and reproducible neuroimaging: From study inception to publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811922007388) A useful paper on how to plan and organise a neuroimaging study
