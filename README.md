# Useful resources for neuroscientists üß† üìö
Simultaneously taking inspiration from others' lists and wanting to have a decidicated space for my own without having to save dozens of tabs, I have decided to create my own (non-exhaustive) list of links and pages for neuroscientists covering neuroimaging, programming and research skills. I aim to update it frequently, and will purposely leave out some resources covered by others which I have not used personally. I also will focus more on resources that are 'online-oriented' i.e., not articles or textbooks, although I will include guides written in the style of an 'online book' as they are interactive and often are the best method of learning. Feel free to star/fork this repo or to suggest your own resources for me to add!

## Existing lists of resources
Here are some current 'meta-lists' which already cover a lot of resources, if you don't see a particularly obvious resource in my list, odds are that it is in one of these: 
- [Methods in Neuro](https://github.com/smweis/methods_in_neuro) Steven Weisberg's GitHub extensive list of resources covering the physics of MRI/fMRI, computational/programming, tools for the analysis of MRI/fMRI data, and online datasets, as part of his 'Methods in Neuroimaging' course at the University of Florida.
- [Hitchhacker's guide to the brain](https://learn-neuroimaging.github.io/hitchhackers_guide_brain/) A 'docs' style website with lists of resources for each stage of neuroimaging analysis including file organisation, planning. preregistration, data collection, pre-processing and analysis, and sharing data. By Remi Gau, McGill University and others.
- [On-line neuroimaging resources](https://github.com/Remi-Gau/online_neuroimaging_resources/blob/master/Main.md) A farily comprehensive list of 'softwares, databases, tutorials, blogs and other resources relevant to learn about neuroimaging or to help perform neuroimaging analysis'. Curated by Remi Gau, McGill University.
- [Dartbrains](https://dartbrains.org/content/intro.html) A notebook style introduction to neuroimaging in `Python`. The materials cover how scanner generates data, how psychological states can be probed in the scanner, and how this data can be processed and analyzed. Created by Luke Chang, Dartmouth College.
- [Awesome statistics](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-statistics) This list covers the different aspects of statistics, including probability, causality, hypothesis testing, statistical tests (correlation, regression, Bayesian, Meta-analysis, machine learning), data visulatization and software. In total there are 279 links in the GitHub repo, but the attached dataset in the repository has 1838!! Created by Erik Gahner Lahsen, who also created [Awesome ggplot2](https://github.com/erikgahner/awesome-ggplot2), a similar collection of links for learning about `ggplot2`.

## Philosophy of neuroscience
What are the limitations of fMRI? What can/can't we infer about the brain using neuroimaging? What does it mean to observe statistically significant activity of the prefrontal cortex in response to a specific stimulus? Asking fundamental questions such as these are pivotal as neuroscientists to understand what our tools can and cannot be used for in our research.

Artificial intelligence is now a pivotal component of academic work, whether we like for it to be or not. Whilst AI tools such as GPT were initially not recommended to be used for literature searches and summaries, recent models trained on domain-specific data (i.e., research papers) are significantly more effective, and are not plagued by the previous limitations such as generating fake references.
### General search engines/chatbots
